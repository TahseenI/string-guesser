# Details
A quick little string guesser game. This is mostly an exercise for myself to get back into C++. 
This is pretty much Wordle but with random characters instead of words in a word bank/dictionary. Plays on the Command Line.

# Instructions to Compile (Any C++ Compiler w/ Command Line):
```
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main.exe
```

# Improvements for a later date:
- Code cleanup, better comments (should make both modules into their own CPP files)
- Guessing Accuracy (some edge cases exist)
- Word bank instead of randomized string
- Guessing Efficiency
- Visualize what inputs already made

- Weird bug with string lengths > 10, idk why
