A quick little string guesser game. This is mostly an exercise for myself to get back into C++. 

You can think of it as a scuffed Wordle.

Improvements for a later date:
- Code cleanup
- Guessing with duplicate letters needs to be more accurate (if guess has 3 of the same letter & original has 2 --> still outputs X for the extra)
- Limit number of guesses
- Different letter count in words (ie. not 5)
- Word bank instead of randomized string
- Guessing Efficiency
